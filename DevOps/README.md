####Initial Setup:

When you are setting up a new GAME directory, if there is no ./gamec executable present, then please run the following command:

    make

You will only need to run this command once for a directory as the ./gamec executable does not need updating.

####To Run:

    ./gamec [.game file]
    python run.py [.game.py file]
